# AlphaCare Insurance Solutions: Data Analytics Project

## Overview
AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) aims to refine its marketing approach and identify low-risk customer segments to offer competitive premium rates. This project leverages risk and predictive analytics to enhance insurance planning and marketing strategies by analyzing historical insurance claim data.

## Objectives
1. **Analyze historical insurance claim data** to optimize ACIS's marketing strategy and risk assessment procedures.
2. **Identify low-risk customer segments** to offer competitive premium rates and attract new clients.
3. **Utilize data analytics techniques** to uncover actionable insights and support data-driven decision-making.

## Key Areas of Analysis
1. **Insurance Terminologies**: Review key insurance terms and concepts for clarity and precision.
2. **A/B Hypothesis Testing**: Evaluate hypotheses related to risk differences and profit margins across different geographical and demographic segments.
3. **Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling**: Predict and optimize premium values using advanced modeling techniques.

## Methodologies
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Convert the .txt file to CSV, and clean the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Validate or reject proposed hypotheses using A/B testing.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Build models using linear regression and machine learning algorithms.
5. **Feature Analysis**: Evaluate the importance and impact of various features on predictive models.
